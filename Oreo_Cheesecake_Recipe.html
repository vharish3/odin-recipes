        <li><strong>Salted Butter</strong> 1/4 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Cheese</strong> 8 ounces</li>

        <li><strong>Salt</strong> 1/4 teaspoon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with heavy-duty foil, allowing 2 inches of overhang on two opposite sides of the pan. Coat foil lightly with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Place 30 cookies in a food processor. Cover and pulse until finely ground.</li>
        <li>Add melted butter and pulse just until combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared pan. Press crumbs evenly into the bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Beat until just combined.</li>
        <li>Coarsely crush the remaining oreos by placing them in a resealable bag and hitting it with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of the cookie crumbs. Fold the remaining crumbs into the batter.</li>
        <li>Pour batter evenly over prebaked crust, smoothing the top as necessary.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with reserved cookie crumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center appears set, with a slight jiggle, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool in a pan on a wire rack for 2 hours, or until completely cool. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove uncut bars from the pan by lifting foil.</li>
        <li>Cut into 2x2-inch bars to serve. Enjoy!</li>
