# odin-recipes
This is the Recipe project from the Odin Project Curriculum.

Pre-Game Interview: 

gonna be pretty barebones to start, but I am thinking of improving it to try new things practice.

Post-Game Interview: 

this was quite a good excercise. I hadn't touched the Odin Project for a couple of days so this project was a good excercise to remind myself of the basics of html. Hope to add more recipes and improve the page later on.
